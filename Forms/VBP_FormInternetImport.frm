'Internet Interface (for importing images directly from a URL)
'©2000-2012 Tanner Helland
'Created: 08/June/12
'Last updated: 15/June/12
'Last update: further hardened error handling.  Image URLs are now checked for invalid Windows filenames
'             (important since we name our temporary file after the URL to ensure that all the image class
'             data populates correctly); invalid characters are now replaced by an underscore.
'
'Interface for downloading images directly from the Internet into PhotoDemon.  This code is a heavily
' modified version of publicly available code by Alberto Falossi (http://www.devx.com/vb2themax/Tip/19203).
'
'A number of features have been added to the original version of this code.  The routine checks the file download
' size, and updates the user (via progress bar) on the download progress.  Many checks are in place to protect
' against Internet and download errors.  I'm quite proud of how robust this implementation is, but additional
' testing will be necessary to make sure no possible connectivity errors have been overlooked.
