GoRC is currently used to build PhotoDemon's resource file.  You can download a free copy at:

PhotoDemon's resource file contains a massive amount of custom-built resources.  See the main program's Tools > Developers menu for more details on how these resources are constructed.

Also note that a modified resource file may cause crashes, errors, or other instability.  No support is currently provided for anything but the default .res file that ships with the current PhotoDemon build.
