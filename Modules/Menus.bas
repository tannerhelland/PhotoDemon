'PhotoDemon has an extensive menu system.  Managing all those menus is cumbersome.
' This module handles the worst parts of run-time maintenance.
'
'Because PD's menus provide an organized collection of program features, this module also handles
' some module-adjacent tasks, like the ProcessDefaultAction-prefixed functions.  You can pass these
' functions a menu name (or caption), and they will automatically initiate the corresponding
' program action.  The long-term goal is to use these links to handle run-time hotkey mapping.
