'Drawing a line using Wu's algorithm
'===========================================================================================================
'Wu invented a very simple way of anti-aliasing a line, by determining the differences between a line and
'its plotted point. He then blends pixels based on their distance from the ideal line, fairly simply
'This is fairly fast and looks good - it uses two pixels to represent a "blurred" version of the line
'the eye sees this as quite nice as it is fooled into not seeing jaggies
