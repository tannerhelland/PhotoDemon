'Undo/Redo Handler

'Last updated: 12/August/12
'Last update: BuildImageRestore requests are now required to supply the ID of the process requesting
'             Undo generation.  This is used to generate text related to undos (e.g. "Undo Blur")
'
'Handles all "Undo"/"Redo" operations.  I currently have it programmed to use the hard
'drive for all backups in order to free up RAM; this could be changed with in-memory images,
'but the speed delay is so insignificant that I opted to use the hard drive.
'
'IMPORTANT NOTE: the pdImages() array (of type pdImage) is declared in the
'                MDIWindow module.
