'Note: this file has been heavily modified for use within PhotoDemon.  The vast majority of the code is copied directly from the official
' VB6 wrapper by Carsten Klein, but I have stripped out unused functions, retyped certain enums (to work more nicely with PD's custom
' systems), and directly modified a few functions to handle data more easily for PD's purposes.

' General notes on implementation and design
'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

' General:

' Most of the pointer type parameters used in the FreeImage API are actually
' declared as Long in VB. That is also true for return values. 'Out' parameters
' are declared ByRef, so they can receive the provided address of the pointer.
' 'In' parameters are declared ByVal since in VB the Long variable is not a
' pointer type but contains the address of the pointer.


' Functions returning a special type:

' Some of the following external function declarations of the FreeImage 3 functions
' are declared Private. Additionally the token 'Int' is appended to the VB function
' name, what means 'Internal' to avoid naming confusion. All of these return a value
' of a certain type that can't be used with a declared function in VB directly but
' would need the function to be declared in a type library. Since this wrapper module
' should not depend on a compile time type library, these functions require some extra
' work to be done and also a VB wrapper function to make them look like the C/C++
' function.


' Functions returning Strings:

' Some of the declared FreeImage functions are defined as 'const char *' in C/C++
' and so actually return a string pointer. Without using a type library for declaring
' these functions, in VB it is impossible to declare these functions to return a
' VB String type. So each of these functions is wrapped by a VB implemented function
' named correctly according to the FreeImage API, actually returning a 'real' VB String.


' Functions returning Booleans:

' A Boolean is a numeric 32 bit value in both C/C++ and VB. In C/C++ TRUE is defined
' as 1 whereas in VB True is -1 (all bits set). When a function is declared as 'Boolean'
' in VB, the return value (all 32 bits) of the called function is just used "as is" and
' maybe assigned to a VB boolean variable. A Boolean in VB is 'False' when the numeric
' value is NULL (0) and 'True' in any other case. So, at a first glance, everything
' would be great since both numeric values -1 (VB True) and 1 (C/C++ TRUE) are actually
' 'True' in VB.
' But, if you have a VB variable (or a function returning a Boolean) with just some bits
' set and use the VB 'Not' operator, the result is not what you would expect. In this
' case, if bTest is True, (Not bTest) is also True. The 'Not' operator just toggles all
' bits by XOR-ing the value with -1. So, the result is not so surprisingly any more:
' The C/C++ TRUE value is 0...0001. When all bits are XORed with 1, the result is
' 1...1110 what is also not NULL (0) so this is still 'True' in VB.
' The resolution is to convert these return values into real VB Booleans in a wrapper
' function, one for each declared FreeImage function. Therefore each C/C++ BOOL
' function is declared Private as xxxInt(...). A Public Boolean wrapper function
' xxx(...) returns a real Boolean with 'xxx = (xxxInt(...) = 1)'.


' Extended and derived functions:

' Some of the functions are additionally provided in an extended, call it a more VB
' friendly version, named '...Ex'. For example look at the 'FreeImage_GetPaletteEx'
' function. Most of them are dealing with arrays and so actually return a VB style
' array of correct type.

' The wrapper also includes some derived functions that should make life easier for
' not only a VB programmer.

' Better VB interoperability is given by offering conversion between DIBs and
' VB Picture objects. See the FreeImage_CreateFromOlePicture and
' FreeImage_GetOlePicture functions.

' Both known VB functions LoadPicture() and SavePicture() are provided in extended
' versions calles LoadPictureEx() and SavePictureEx() offering the FreeImage 3´s
' image file types.

' The FreeImage 3 error handling is provided in VB after calling the VB specific
' function FreeImage_InitErrorHandler()


' Enumerations:

' All of the enumaration members are additionally 'declared' as constants in a
' conditional compiler directive '#If...#Then' block that is actually unreachable.
' For example see:
'
' Public Enum FREE_IMAGE_QUANTIZE
'    FIQ_WUQUANT = 0           ' Xiaolin Wu color quantization algorithm
'    FIQ_NNQUANT = 1           ' NeuQuant neural-net quantization algorithm by Anthony Dekker
' End Enum
' #If False Then
'    Const FIQ_WUQUANT = 0
'    Const FIQ_NNQUANT = 1
' #End If
'
' Since this module is supposed to be used directly in VB projects rather than in
' compiled form (mybe through an ActiveX-DLL), this is for tweaking some ugly VB
' behaviour regarding enumerations. Enum members are automatically adjusted in case
' by the VB IDE whenever you type these members in wrong case. Since these are also
' constants now, they are no longer adjusted to wrong case but always corrected
' according to the definition of the constant. As the expression '#If False Then'
' actually never comes true, these constants are not really defined either when running
' in the VB IDE nor in compiled form.

' Change Log
'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'* : fixed
'- : removed
'! : changed
'+ : added
'
'October 1, 2012 - 2.17
'- [Carsten Klein] removed temporary workaround for 16-bit standard type bitmaps introduced in version 2.15, which temporarily stored RGB masks directly after the BITMAPINFO structure, when creating a HBITMAP.
'* [Carsten Klein] fixed a potential overflow bug in both pNormalizeRational and pNormalizeSRational: these now do nothing if any of numerator and denominator is either 1 or 0 (zero).
'+ [Carsten Klein] added load flag JPEG_GREYSCALE as well as the enum constant FILO_JPEG_GREYSCALE.
'! [Carsten Klein] changed constant FREEIMAGE_RELEASE_SERIAL to 4 to match current version 3.15.4
'
'! now FreeImage version 3.15.4

   ' This function returns a VB style array of type Long, containing

   ' to the actual palette data provided by FreeImage. This is done by
   ' creating a VB array with an own SAFEARRAY descriptor making the
   ' array point to the palette pointer returned by FreeImage_GetPalette().
   
   ' The function actually returns an array of type RGBQUAD with each
   ' element packed into a Long. This is possible, since the RGBQUAD
   ' structure is also four bytes in size. Palette data, stored in an
   ' array of type Long may be passed ByRef to a function through an
   ' optional paremeter. For an example have a look at function
   ' FreeImage_ConvertColorDepth()
   
   ' This makes you use code like you would in C/C++:
   
   ' // this code assumes there is a bitmap loaded and
   ' // present in a variable called dib
   ' if(FreeImage_GetBPP(Bitmap) == 8) {
   '   // Build a greyscale palette
   '   RGBQUAD *pal = FreeImage_GetPalette(Bitmap);
   '   for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
   '     pal[i].rgbRed = i;
   '     pal[i].rgbGreen = i;
   '     pal[i].rgbBlue = i;
   '   }
   
   ' As in C/C++ the array is only valid while the DIB is loaded and the
   ' palette data remains where the pointer returned by FreeImage_GetPalette()
   ' has pointed to when this function was called. So, a good thing would
   ' be, not to keep the returned array in scope over the lifetime of the
   ' Bitmap. Best practise is, to use this function within another routine and
   ' assign the return value (the array) to a local variable only. As soon
   ' as this local variable goes out of scope (when the calling function
   ' returns to it's caller), the array and the descriptor is automatically
   ' cleaned up by VB.
   
   ' This function does not make a deep copy of the palette data, but only
   ' wraps a VB array around the FreeImage palette data. So, it can be called
   ' frequently "on demand" or somewhat "in place" without a significant
   ' performance loss.
   
   ' To learn more about this technique I recommend reading chapter 2 (Leveraging
   ' Arrays) of Matthew Curland's book "Advanced Visual Basic 6"
   
   ' The parameter 'Bitmap' works according to the FreeImage 3 API documentation.
   
   ' To reuse the caller's array variable, this function's result was assigned to,
   ' before it goes out of scope, the caller's array variable must be destroyed with
   ' the 'FreeImage_DestroyLockedArray' function.

   ' also as a real VB-style array of type Long, where each Long item takes a color
   ' in ARGB format (&HAARRGGBB). The native FreeImage function FreeImage_ColorQuantizeEx
   ' is declared private and named FreeImage_ColorQuantizeExInt and so hidden from the
   ' world outside the wrapper.
   
   ' In contrast to the FreeImage API documentation, ReservePalette is of type Variant
   ' and may either be a pointer to palette data (pointer to an array of type RGBQUAD
   ' == VarPtr(atMyPalette(0)) in VB) or an array of type Long, which then must contain
   ' the palette data in ARGB format. You can receive palette data as an array Longs
   ' from function FreeImage_GetPaletteExLong.
   ' Although ReservePalette is of type Variant, arrays of type RGBQUAD can not be
   ' passed, as long as RGBQUAD is not declared as a public type in a public object
   ' module. So, when dealing with RGBQUAD arrays, you are stuck on VarPtr or may
   ' use function FreeImage_GetPalettePtr, which is a more meaningfully named
   ' convenience wrapper around VarPtr.

   ' All other parameters work according to the FreeImage API documentation.
   
   ' Note: Currently, any provided ReservePalette is only used, if quantize is
   '       FIQ_NNQUANT. This seems to be either a bug or an undocumented

   ' This function is a easy-to-use wrapper for rescaling an image with the
   ' FreeImage library. It returns a pointer to a new rescaled DIB provided
   ' by FreeImage.
   
   ' The parameters 'Width', 'Height' and 'IsPercentValue' control
   ' the size of the new image. Here, the function tries to fake something like
   ' overloading known from Java. It depends on the parameter's data type passed
   ' through the Variant, how the provided values for width and height are
   ' actually interpreted. The following rules apply:
   
   ' In general, non integer values are either interpreted as percent values or
   ' factors, the original image size will be multiplied with. The 'IsPercentValue'
   ' parameter controls whether the values are percent values or factors. Integer
   ' values are always considered to be the direct new image size, not depending on
   ' the original image size. In that case, the 'IsPercentValue' parameter has no
   ' effect. If one of the parameters is omitted, the image will not be resized in
   ' that direction (either in width or height) and keeps it's original size. It is
   ' possible to omit both, but that makes actually no sense.
   
   ' The following table shows some of possible data type and value combinations
   ' that might by used with that function: (assume an original image sized 100x100 px)
   
   ' Parameter         |  Values |  Values |  Values |  Values |     Values |

   ' This function paints a device independent bitmap to any device context and
   ' thereby honors any transparency information associated with the bitmap.
   ' Furthermore, through the 'Alpha' parameter, an overall transparency level
   ' may be specified.
   
   ' For palletised images, any color set to be transparent in the transparency
   ' table, will be transparent. For high color images, only 32-bit images may
   ' have any transparency information associated in their alpha channel. Only
   ' these may be painted with transparency by this function.
   
   ' Since this is a wrapper for the Windows GDI function AlphaBlend(), 31-bit
   ' images, containing alpha (or per-pixel) transparency, must be 'premultiplied'
   ' for alpha transparent regions to actually show transparent. See MSDN help
   ' on the AlphaBlend() function.
   
   ' FreeImage also offers a function to premultiply 32-bit bitmaps with their alpha
   ' channel, according to the needs of AlphaBlend(). Have a look at function
   ' FreeImage_PreMultiplyWithAlpha().
   
   ' Overall transparency level may be specified for all bitmaps in all color
   ' depths supported by FreeImage. If needed, bitmaps are transparently converted
   ' to 32-bit and unloaded after the paint operation. This is also true for palletised
   ' bitmaps.
   
   ' Parameters 'hDC' and 'Bitmap' seem to be very self-explanatory. All other parameters
   ' are optional. The group of '*Dest*' parameters span a rectangle on the destination
   ' device context, used as drawing area for the bitmap. If these are omitted, the
   ' bitmap will be drawn starting at position 0,0 in the bitmap's actual size.
   ' The group of '*Src*' parameters span a rectangle on the source bitmap, used as
   ' cropping area for the paint operation. If both rectangles differ in size in any
   ' direction, the part of the image actually painted is stretched for to fit into
   ' the drawing area. If any of the parameters '*Width' or '*Height' are omitted,
   ' the bitmap's actual size (width or height) will be used.
   
   ' The 'Alpha' parameter specifies the overall transparency. It takes values in the
   ' range from 0 to 255. Using 0 will paint the bitmap fully transparent, 255 will
   ' paint the image fully opaque. The 'Alpha' value controls, how the non per-pixel
   ' portions of the image will be drawn.

   ' This function is an easy to use replacement for FreeImage's FreeImage_Save()
   ' function which supports inline size- and color conversions as well as an
   ' auto image format detection algorithm that determines the desired image format
   ' by the given filename. An even more sophisticated algorithm may auto-detect
   ' the proper color depth for a explicitly given or auto-detected image format.

   ' The function provides all image formats, and save options, the FreeImage
   ' library can write. The optional parameter 'Format' may contain the desired
   ' image format. When omitted, the function tries to get the image format from
   ' the filename extension.
   
   ' The optional parameter 'ColorDepth' may contain the desired color depth for
   ' the saved image. This can be either any value of the FREE_IMAGE_COLOR_DEPTH
   ' enumeration or the value FICD_AUTO what is the default value of the parameter.
   ' When 'ColorDepth' is FICD_AUTO, the function tries to get the most suitable
   ' color depth for the specified image format if the image's current color depth
   ' is not supported by the specified image format. Therefore, the function
   ' firstly reduces the color depth step by step until a proper color depth is
   ' found since an incremention would only increase the file's size with no
   ' quality benefit. Only when there is no lower color depth is found for the
   ' image format, the function starts to increase the color depth.
   
   ' Keep in mind that an explicitly specified color depth that is not supported
   ' by the image format results in a runtime error. For example, when saving
   ' a 24 bit image as GIF image, a runtime error occurs.
   
   ' The function checks, whether the given filename has a valid extension or
   ' not. If not, the "primary" extension for the used image format will be
   ' appended to the filename. The parameter 'Filename' remains untouched in
   ' this case.
   
   ' To learn more about the "primary" extension, read the documentation for
   ' the 'FreeImage_GetPrimaryExtensionFromFIF' function.
   
   ' The parameters 'Width', 'Height', 'InPercent' and 'Filter' make it possible
   ' to save the image in a resized version. 'Width', 'Height' specify the desired
   ' width and height, 'Filter' determines, what image filter should be used
   ' on the resizing process. Since FreeImage_SaveEx relies on FreeImage_RescaleEx,
   ' please refer to the documentation of FreeImage_RescaleEx to learn more
   ' about these four parameters.
   
   ' The optional 'UnloadSource' parameter is for unloading the saved image, so
   ' you can save and unload an image with this function in one operation.
   ' CAUTION: at current, the image is unloaded, even if the image was not
   '          saved correctly!

Public Function FreeImage_DestroyLockedArray(ByRef Data As Variant) As Long

Dim lpArrayPtr As Long

   ' This function destroys an array, that was self created with a custom
   ' array descriptor of type ('fFeatures' member) 'FADF_AUTO Or FADF_FIXEDSIZE'.
   ' Such arrays are returned by mostly all of the array-dealing wrapper
   ' functions. Since these should not destroy the actual array data, when
   ' going out of scope, they are craeted as 'FADF_FIXEDSIZE'.'
   
   ' So, VB sees them as fixed or temporarily locked, when you try to manipulate
   ' the array's dimensions. There will occur some strange effects, you should
   ' know about:
   
   ' 1. When trying to 'ReDim' the array, this run-time error will occur:
   '    Error #10, 'This array is fixed or temporarily locked'
   
   ' 2. When trying to assign another array to the array variable, this
   '    run-time error will occur:
   '    Error #13, 'Type mismatch'
   
   ' 3. The 'Erase' statement has no effect on the array
   
   ' Although VB clears up these arrays correctly, when the array variable
   ' goes out of scope, you have to destroy the array manually, when you want
   ' to reuse the array variable in current scope.
   
   ' For an example assume, that you want do walk all scanlines in an image:
   
   ' For i = 0 To FreeImage_GetHeight(Bitmap)
   '
   '    ' assign scanline-array to array variable
   '    abByte = FreeImage_GetScanLineEx(Bitmap, i)
   '
   '    ' do some work on it...
   '
   '    ' destroy the array (only the array, not the actual data)
   '    Call FreeImage_DestroyLockedArray(dbByte)
   ' Next i
   
   ' The function returns zero on success and any other value on failure
   
   ' !! Attention !!
   ' This function uses a Variant parameter for passing the array to be
   ' destroyed. Since VB does not allow to pass an array of non public
   ' structures through a Variant parameter, this function can not be used
   ' with arrays of cutom type.
   
   ' You will get this compiler error: "Only public user defined types defined
   ' in public object modules can be used as parameters or return types for
   ' public procedures of class modules or as fields of public user defined types"
   
   ' So, there is a function in the wrapper called 'FreeImage_DestroyLockedArrayByPtr'
   ' that takes a pointer to the array variable which can be used to work around
   ' that VB limitation and furthermore can be used for any of these self-created
   ' arrays. To get the array variable's pointer, a declared version of the
   ' VB 'VarPtr' function can be used which works for all types of arrays expect
   ' String arrays. Declare this function like this in your code:
   
   ' Private Declare Function VarPtrArray Lib "msvbvm60.dll" Alias "VarPtr" ( _
         ByRef Ptr() As Any) As Long
         
   ' Then an array could be destroyed by calling the 'FreeImage_DestroyLockedArrayByPtr'
   ' function like this:
   
   ' lResult = FreeImage_DestroyLockedArrayByPtr(VarPtrArray(MyLockedArray))
   
   ' Additionally there are some handy wrapper functions available, one for each
   ' commonly used structure in FreeImage like RGBTRIPLE, RGBQUAD, FICOMPLEX etc.
   
   
   ' Currently, these functions do return 'FADF_AUTO Or FADF_FIXEDSIZE' arrays
   ' that must be destroyed using this or any of it's derived functions:
   
   ' FreeImage_GetPaletteEx()           with FreeImage_DestroyLockedArrayRGBQUAD()
   ' FreeImage_GetPaletteLong()         with FreeImage_DestroyLockedArray()
