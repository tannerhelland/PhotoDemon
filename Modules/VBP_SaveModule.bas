'Last updated: 03/June/12
'Last update: Rewrite all save code against FreeImage v3.15.3, which is faster, cleaner,
'             and more reliable than the ten-year-old version PD was originally designed
'             to work with.  The new version also enabled support for new file formats
'             (including GIF!).
'
'Module for handling all image saving.  It contains pretty much every routine that I find useful;
' the majority of the functions are simply interfaces to FreeImage, so if that is not enabled than
' only a subset of these matter.
