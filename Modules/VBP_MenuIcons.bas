'Specialized Icon Handler

'Created: 24/June/12
'Last updated: 06/August/12
'Last update: Added CreateCustomFormIcon, which sets the icon of an MDI child form to match its contained image
'
'Because VB6 doesn't provide many mechanisms for working with icons, I've had to manually add a number of
' icon-related functions to PhotoDemon.  First is a way to add icons/bitmaps to menus, as originally written
' by Leandro Ascierto.  Menu icons are extracted from a resource file (where they're stored in PNG format) and
' rendered to the menu at run-time.  See the clsMenuImage class for details on how this works.
' (A link to Leandro's original project can also be found there.)
'
'NOTE: Because the Windows XP version of Leandro's code utilizes potentially dirty subclassing,
' PhotoDemon automatically disables menu icons while running in the IDE on Windows XP.  Compile the project to see icons.
' (Windows Vista and 7 use a different mechanism, so menu icons are enabled in the IDE, and menu icons appear on all
' versions of Windows when compiled.)
'
'Also in this module is a heavily modified version of Paul Turcksin's "Icon Handlemaker" project, which I've modified
' to convert bitmaps to icons on the fly (the "CreateCustomFormIcon" sub).  PhotoDemon uses this to dynamically change
' the icon of its MDI child forms.  To see Paul's original project, please visit this PSC link:
