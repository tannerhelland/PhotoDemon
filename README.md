## What makes PhotoDemon unique?

### Lightweight and completely portable
No installer is provided or required.  Aside from a temporary folder – which you can specify from the Tools > Options menu – PhotoDemon leaves no trace on your hard drive.  Many users run PhotoDemon from a USB stick or portable drive.

### Integrated macro recording and batch processing
Complex editing actions can be recorded as macros (similar to Office software).  A built-in batch processor lets you apply macros to entire folders of images.

### Usability is paramount
Many open-source photo editors are usability nightmares.  PhotoDemon tries not to be.  Small touches like save/load presets on all tools, unlimited Undo/Redo, "Fade last action", keyboard accelerators, effect previews, mouse wheel and X-button support, and descriptive menu icons make it fast and easy to use.

### Pro-grade features and tools
* Extensive file format support, including Adobe Photoshop files (PSD) and all major camera RAW formats
* Color-managed workflow, including full support for embedded ICC profiles
* Non-destructive editing for select features, including resizing, rotation, and common adjustments
* 2D transformations: advanced rescale operators (Sinc, Catmull-Rom, etc), content-aware scaling (seam carving), crop, straighten, shear, zoom
* Adjustment tools: levels, curves, HDR, shadow/highlight recovery, white balance, Wratten filters, and many more
* Filters and effects: perspective correction, edge detection, noise removal, content-aware blur, unsharp masking, green screen, lens diffraction, vignetting, and many more
* More than 200 tools are provided in the current build.

### Limitations

* PhotoDemon isn't designed for OSes other than Microsoft Windows.  A compatibility layer like Wine (http://www.winehq.org/) may allow it to work on OSX, Linux, or BSD systems, but program stability and performance may suffer.
