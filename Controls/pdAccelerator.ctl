'PhotoDemon Accelerator ("Hotkey") handler
'Copyright 2013-2017 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 06/November/15 (formally split off from a heavily modified vbaIHookControl by Steve McMahon
'Last updated: 09/February/17
'Last update: migrate to safer comctl32 subclassing technique
'
'For many years, PD used vbAccelerator's "hook control" to handle program hotkeys:
' http://www.vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Code/Libraries/Hooks/Accelerator_Control/article.asp
'
'Starting in August 2013 (https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/commit/373882e452201bb00584a52a791236e05bc97c1e),
' I rewrote much of the control to solve some glaring stability issues.  Over time, I rewrote it more and more
' (https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/commits/master/Controls/vbalHookControl.ctl), tacking on PD-specific
' features and attempting to fix problematic bugs, until ultimately the control became a horrible mishmash of
' spaghetti code: some old, some new, some completely unused, and some that was still problematic and unreliable.
'
'Because dynamic hooking has enormous potential for causing hard-to-replicate bugs, a ground-up rewrite seemed long
' overdue.  Hence this new control.
'
'Many thanks to Steve McMahon for his original implementation, which was my first introduction to hooking from VB6.
' It's still a fine reference for beginners, and you can find the original here (good as of November '15):
