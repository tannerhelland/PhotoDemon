'PhotoDemon Accelerator ("Hotkey") handler
'Copyright 2013-2025 by Tanner Helland and contributors
'Created: 06/November/15 (split off from a heavily modified vbaIHookControl by Steve McMahon)
'Last updated: 06/October/21
'Last update: map "duplicate" virtual key IDs (e.g. keyboard + and numpad +) to the same internal key ID;
'             doing that here spares us from needing to track it in the hotkey collection
'
'In its early years, PD used a "hook control" by vbAccelerator.com to handle program hotkeys:
' http://www.vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Code/Libraries/Hooks/Accelerator_Control/article.asp
'
'In 2013, I rewrote the control to solve some glaring stability issues.  Over time, I rewrote it more
' and more, tacking on PhotoDemon-specific features and attempting to fix problematic bugs,
' until ultimately the control grew into a horrible mishmash of spaghetti code: some old, some new,
' some completely unused, and too much of it that remained stubbornly unreliable.
'
'Because dynamic hooking has enormous potential for causing hard-to-replicate bugs, a ground-up
' rewrite seemed long overdue.  Thus this control was born.
'
'Thank you to Steve McMahon for his original implementation, which was my first introduction to
' hooking from VB6.  Steve's work is still a useful reference for beginners, and you can find the
' original here (hopefully... Steve's work has intermittently disappeared from the web in recent years):
' http://www.vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Code/Libraries/Hooks/Accelerator_Control/
'
'Thank you also to Jason Brown (https://github.com/jpbro), who submitted many fixes and improvements to
' this module over the years.  Hotkey behavior in PhotoDemon is greatly improved thanks to him.

'This control only raises a single event: "HotkeyPressed".  This event is raised when a valid hotkey
' mapping is recognized (e.g. the hotkey has been validated by PD's central hotkey manager).
'
'At present, the only consumer of these events is FormMain, and FormMain basically just relays the
' raised hotkey ID back to PD's central hotkey manager for further action.  (This separation of duties
' is useful because if FormMain is disabled for some reason, hotkey handling gets properly postponed too.)

'PhotoDemon previously used on-demand virtual-key tracking for hotkeys, but this proved to be a bad
' idea because system hotkeys that switch focus between apps (e.g. Alt+Tab) throw off our tracking
' state(s).  A better solution is to manually track key up/down state for Ctrl/Alt/Shift presses and
' cache the results locally (see https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/issues/267 for details.)

' when the first attempt at hooking fails (during program startup) but *not* subsequent attempts.
