'PhotoDemon Window Manager class
'Copyright 2013-2025 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 02/October/13
'Last updated: 04/March/25
'Last update: improve saving/restoring window location for child windows
'
'PhotoDemon first began as a single-pane, single-image editor.  About a decade ago,
' I rewrote it as an MDI project, and in 2013 I rewrote it again - this time, to a
' tabbed interface in line with the UI trends of the era.
'
'This class came into existence during the 2013 rewrite, as a way to better manage
' complex window interactions.  It has been rewritten quite a few times over the years
' as new window management techniques have emerged, and at present, it's a thin shell
' of its original (very complex) form.
'
'In order to perform detailed window management, this class subclasses multiple forms
' and/or window messages.  I've made it as IDE-safe as I can, but breakpoints may cause
' problems.  Consider yourself warned.  (Also, some window order API calls do not
' function properly in the IDE per http://support.microsoft.com/kb/192254.
' Like everything else in PD, compile for best results.)
'
'Also, special thanks to VB coder Merri for a simple trick that enables Unicode window captions
' (http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?527802-VB6-UniCaption).
