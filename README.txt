PhotoDemon v4.1 - Copyright (c) 2012 by Tanner Helland
=====================================================================================
A free, open-source image processing tool.
http://tannerhelland.com


What makes PhotoDemon preferable to other image editing tools?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: Portable and lightweight
	PhotoDemon can be run as a standalone .exe.  No installer is provided or required.
	An INI file is used to store program settings, and if no INI is found, PhotoDemon
	will generate one for you.  (PhotoDemon does not touch the Windows registry.)

:: Powerful macro and batch conversion support
	PhotoDemon provides full macro support.  Simply hit "Record Macro", then perform
	as many actions as you'd like.  When finished, save that macro to the hard drive
	so you can repeat it at any point in the future.  Macros fully integrate with a
	built-in batch conversion tool - simply choose a saved macro and a folder or list 
	of images, and PhotoDemon will apply the macro to every image automagically.
		
:: Emphasis on usability.
	Most free, open-source image editors are usability nightmares.  PhotoDemon tries
	not to be.  Rather than including thousands of features that no human being will 
	ever use, PhotoDemon focuses on a solid set of common filters and image adjustment
	tools.  Similarly, the interface was built with input from professional designers,
	(not just software engineers!).

		
What doesn't PhotoDemon do?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: Painting tools.
	PhotoDemon does not provide any painting tools.  It only supports actions and
	filters that operate on an entire image.

:: Alpha-channels (transparency) and high bit-depths
	PhotoDemon will happily import images with alpha channels or bit-depths greater
	than 16 million colors.  However, it will internally convert these images to true
	color (24-bit RGB) before operating on them, and it will only save images in 
	non-alpha 8 or 24-bit color depths.  If you need alpha or deep color support,
	PhotoDemon is not for you.
		
:: Advanced color management (ICC profiles)
	PhotoDemon ignores embedded ICC profiles.  As a tool designed for consumers and
	hobbyists, it is unlikely to ever gain ICC profile support.  If color management
	is integral to your work, PhotoDemon is not the right tool for you.  (Note: if
	you're interested, PhotoDemon relies on DIB sections via the Windows GDI, which
	default to the sRGB space - http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/query/ms536845)
		
:: Run on non-Windows operating systems...probably
	Wine (http://www.winehq.org/) finally added full DIB support in March 2012 (v1.4).
	Because PhotoDemon relies heavily on DIB sections, it may work on OSX, Linux, BSD,
	Solaris or Maemo systems with Wine v1.4 (or later) installed.  However, should you
	choose to go down this route, you are effectively on your own.  PhotoDemon's
	developers don't have the resources to support Wine in any official capacity.

[3] How to support PhotoDemon:
=====================================================================================

PhotoDemon is written and maintained by a single individual (with a family to support!).  
It is provided free-of-charge under an extremely permissive open-source license, and no
fees or money will ever be charged for its use.

That said, donations go a long way toward supporting the development of this powerful
image editing tool.  If you would like to donate and support PhotoDemon's development,
please visit:
http://www.tannerhelland.com/donate/

While I can't make any promises, I have been known to give extra attention to feature
requests from individuals who donate.  :)

If you can't contribute monetarily to the project, here are other ways to help:

* Let me know if you find any bugs.  Issues can be submitted via PhotoDemon's github page:
  https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon
* Are you a VB6 fiend?  I'm always open to outside bug fixes and feature implementations
  from fellow VB6 programmers.
* Tell friends, family, and other websites about PhotoDemon.  If you know a site that
  tests or reviews image processing tools, email and ask if they've tried it.
* PhotoDemon is missing menu icons for some of its more obscure functions.  Most of the
  current icons come from the free Crystal and Tango icon sets.  If you're capable of 
  designing menu icons with a similar visual style, I'd love to showcase your work.
* Send me an email and let me know how you use PhotoDemon.  I love to hear from users.
  Even if it's a single word - "Thanks!" I'd love to hear it.  Get in touch at:
